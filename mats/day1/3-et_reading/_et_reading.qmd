# Eye-tracking

- in (psycho)linguistics
  + during reading
  + visual world paradigm
- in psychology
  + pupillometry
  + visual search
- but also
  + market research
  + diagnostic tool

## Eye movements

- **saccades**: eye *movements* (e.g., from one word to another)
  + average saccade legnth: 7-9 letters (in alphabetic writing systems)
- **fixations**: 'looking at' something, e.g., a word (little movement)
  + when information is taken in
  + average duration: 225-250ms (ranging 50-600ms)
- **regressions**: saccades to earlier text
  + occurance: 10-15% of saccades in skilled readers

# Eye-tracking during reading

## Eye-tracking reading measures

- inform theories of language processing via linking hypotheses
  + linking visual attention to processing
- typically, we compare reading times as a function of some manipulation
  + e.g., Sally *went*/*goed* to the store.
- longer reading times are taken to reflect processing costs, associated with e.g., sentence complexity or anomalies

## Region of interest (ROI)

- can be anything on-screen
  + sentence-level
  + word/region-level
  + a certain part of the screen

## Measures (dependent variables)

- what we measure = *dependent* variables (usually...)
  + their value *depends* on some *predictor* (e.g., word frequency)

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

- measures of duration (time spent on a region)
  + first fixation
  + first-pass reading time
  + regression path duration
  + total reading time
- data type: *continuous*
  
:::
 
::: {.column width="50%"}

- measures of revisits
  + number of fixations
  + number of regressions in/out
  + regression in/out (yes or no)
  + probability of regressions in/out (0:1)
- data type: *binary* (0,1) or *count*

## Independent variables

- what can influence reading measures? [@juhasz_lexical_2011; @rayner_linguistic_2011; @warren_influence_2011; @clifton_syntactic_2011]
  + some examples:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="26%"}
- Word properties
  - word frequency
  - word length

:::

::: {.column width="37%"}
- Sentence-level influences
  - context (i.e., prediction)
  - semantic or grammatical manipulations

:::

::: {.column width="37%"}
- Inter- and intra-individual
  - domain-specific expertise
  - reading skill level

## What do these measures tell us?

- eye-tracking during reading can tell use *when* and *where* processing costs are incurred
- *early measures* involve "first contact with a word" or region: first-fixation, first-pass reading time [@vasishth_what_2013, p.126]
- *late measures* involve regressions to a region: e.g., total reading time
  + may also include 'spillover' effects from early processing
- eye-tracking during reading measures can therefore tell us about stages of processing
