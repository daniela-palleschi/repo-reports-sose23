  + importance of **reproducible workflow**
  + **communicate** findings

- hands-on exercises in RStudio with the R programming language
  + data **wrangling** (`tidyverse`)

# Reading list

-   this course does not have a heavy reading load, but a few readings are strongly recommended:
    -   Open Science: @kathawalla_easing_2021 
    -   Eye-tracking reading: @clifton_eye_2007; @vasishth_what_2013; 
    -   A short recommendation for statistics for psycholinguists: @vasishth_statistical_2016
    -   Statistics for Linguistics (textbook): @winter_statistics_2019 (E-book available via Grimm)

## Further readings

- there are lots of useful resources out there, specifically:
  + Bodo Winter's tutorials on linear (mixed) models [@winter_linear_2013; @winter_very_2014]
  + the [PsyTeachR](https://psyteachr.github.io/) website is a *great* resource for hands-on stats and/or data analysis in R from the University of Glasgow School of Psychology and Neuroscience
  

# Session Info {.unlisted .unnumbered visibility="uncounted"}

Save your session info at the end of each document. Our results very often depend on the version of R/RStudio/a package we used. This is a great first step towards creating a reproducible workflow!

```{r}
sessionInfo()
