# Replication

> "There is increasing concern that in modern research, false findings may be the majority or even the vast majority of published research claims"
>
> -- <cite>@ioannidis_why_2005</cite>

- replication refers to the re-running a previous experiment with as few differences as possible
  + aim: determine whether the original results were *robust* and are *replicable*
  + if yes, great! the original findings are reliable
  + if no, hmm, maybe the original findings were false positives? or due to some other factor?

- in recent years, researchers have tried to *replicate* classic studies in their field
  + but in many cases, they did not get the same effects the original study reported (and were famous for)
- this began the ***replication crisis***

## An example from language research

- @nieuwland_large-scale_2018: a *direct* EEG^[electroencephalography] replication (versus *conceptual* replication)

::: {style="font-size: 75%"}
  + a multi-lab replication of @delong_probabilistic_2005's impactful paper
    + @delong_probabilistic_2005: reported N400 effects elicted at unexpected nouns, but also on preceding determiners (English *a/an*) when it signalled an unexpected word, 
      + e.g., *The day was breezy so the boy went outside to fly...a kite*/\**an airplane*
      + taken as evidence of pre-activation of phonological form, graded by cloze probability
    + @nieuwland_large-scale_2018: replicated N400 at noun, but not at adjective

# Reproducibility

- reproducibility refers to the ability to *reproduce* somebody's analyses with their
  + data
  + *and* code

## Replication vs. Reproducibility

- **replication** of a study
  + repeating an **experiment**
  + getting *similar* results
- **reproducibility** of analyses
  + repeating **analyses** of the *same data*
  + getting the *same* results
  
- e.g., when you submit a paper to a journal, they make ask for your data and code so reviewers can *reproduce* your analyses
  + requires data and code
- if you have interesting findings, other researchers (or future you) may want to *replicate* your study to see if they can *replicate* your findings
  + (may require) stimuli, set-up and presentation information, participant demographics
  
# Open Science: Why should I care?

1. It's good science
    + Science is cumulative. We should ensure we're building on reliable, robust findings
2. Because the field cares
    + replication/reproducibility are beginning to be foregrounded by e.g., journals/job advertisements
3. Helps future you
    + pre-registration, reprodubible analyses, clean and sharable data all help *future you*
    
## What can I do?

- there are aspects of open science that we can choose to implement
- some suggestions from @kathawalla_easing_2021:

# How to do better science

- don't be afraid of making mistakes
  + (most) researchers aren't statisticians or programmers
  + do the best you can, and ***be transparent***
- doing *some* of the steps is better than doing *none*

# What will we learn here?

# R is for Reproducibility

- we will be working with R, RStudio, Quarto, and RProjects
  + R: a programming language for statistical computing and graphics
  + RStudio: an integrated development environment (IDE)
    - RStudio Desktop
    - RStudio Server
  + Quarto (similar to Rmarkdown): dynamic reports
    - combining text, code, and printed tables and figures
  + RProjects: a workflow tool
    - contains all files necessary for a project
    - works with *relative* file paths

::: {.notes}
Students: open R, then RStudio, then create an RProject
Me: show them each on my computer
- R can run code and save a script
- RStudio has so many more options (cheatsheet)
- RProjects keep everything tidy and together

# Exercises

## R {.smaller}

- R scripts can be written/run in R and RStudio

1. Open R
    - write `3*32` and hit Enter
    - write `print("Hello World!")`
    - write `x <- 3*32`
    - write `y <- "Hello World!"`
    - write `x`
    - write `y`
  
## RStudio {.smaller}

2. Open RStudio
    - locate the Environment, Files, and Console panes
    - File > New File > R script
    - write `[your birth-month number]*[the your birth day]` and hit Enter
    - write `print("Hello World!")`
    - write `number <- 3*32`; this will create an object/variable 'number'
    - write `string <- "Hello World!"`; this will create an object/variable 'string'
    - write `number`
    - write `string`
    - add comments describing each step using `#`
    - File > Save As

## {-}

```{r, eval = T}
#| output-location: column-fragment
```
```{r, eval = T}
#| output-location: column-fragment
# multiply 5 by 7
5*7
```
```{r, eval = T}
#| output-location: column-fragment
# print some text
print("Hello World!")
```
```{r, eval = T}
#| output-location: column-fragment
# save an object 'number' with 5*7
number <- 5*7
```
```{r, eval = T}
#| output-location: column-fragment
# save an object 'string' with text
string <- "Hello World!"
```
```{r, eval = T}
#| output-location: column-fragment
# print number
number
```
```{r, eval = T}
#| output-location: column-fragment
# print string
string
```
```{r, eval = T}
#| output-location: column-fragment
# do math with objects
number+number
```
```{r, eval = T}
#| output-location: column-fragment
number*number
```
```{r, eval = T}
#| output-location: column-fragment
number*2
```
```{r, eval = T}
#| output-location: column-fragment
month <- 5
```
```{r, eval = T}
#| output-location: column-fragment
day <- 7
```
```{r, eval = T}
#| output-location: column-fragment
month*day
```

## Quarto^[https://r4ds.hadley.nz/quarto.html#workflow] {.smaller}

- R scripts are a great way to keep track of what you did
  + however, the output is not saved, and adding comments with `#` gets kind of chunky
  + enter: dynamic reports!
- dynamic reports are those that combine text, code, and output
  + they are a great tool for communicating, collaborating, and documenting
  + they are also fantastic for note-taking
- Rmarkdown vs. Quarto
  + both can combine text with code, outputting PDFs, Word Documents, html, or slides
  + main difference: Quarto has native support of a wider range of programming languages (e.g., Python and Julia)

### YAML

- YAML is a human-readable programming language used to configure documents
- formatting is important: but be sandwiched between `---` and `---`
- in Quarto the output type must at least be given (with R: pdf, html, revealjs)

```{r, eval = F}
#| code-line-numbers: false
---
title: "My title"
author: "My name"
output: html
---
```

### Headings and text

- headings are indicated by `#`
  + the number of `#`'s indicates the heading level

```{r, eval = F}
# This is a heading

This is text.

## This is a sub-heading

This is more text.
```

### Code snippets

- sandwiched between ````{r}` and `\````
  + shortcut: Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+I

```{r}
#| results: asis

# do some math
year <- 1989
dog <- "Lola"
```

### In-line code

- code output that was run *above* text can be called in-line using \``r` \`

```{r, eval = F}
I was born on `r month`/`r day`/`r year`. My dog's name is `r dog`.
```



I was born on `r month`/`r day`/`r year`. My dog's name is `r dog`.

### Altogether

````markdown
---
title: "My title"
author: "My name"
output: html
---

# This is a heading

This is text.

## This is a sub-heading

This is more text.
# do some math
year <- 1989
dog <- "Lola"


`r ''````{r}
# do some math
year <- 1989
dog <- "Lola"
```

`I was born on `r month`/`r day`/`r year`. My dog's name is `r dog`.`

### Quarto Exercises
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

3. Create a new Quarto document
    - File > New File > Quarto Document
    - Read the instructions
    - Practice running the chunks individually
    - render the document
    - verify that you can modify the code, re-run it, and see modified output
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

4. Create one new Quarto document for each of the three built-in formats: HTML, PDF and Word. 
    - Render each of the three documents
    - How do the outputs differ? 
    - How do the inputs differ?^[You may need to install LaTeX in order to build the PDF output — RStudio will prompt you if this is necessary.]
