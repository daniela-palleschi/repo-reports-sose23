Materials for a block course "Reproducible analysis reports with eye-tracking reading time data" (summer semester 2023)

From the course AGNES:

> This course will provide students with the skills and know-how needed to create reproducible reports and presentations of eye-tracking reading data. A brief introduction will be given into common measures in eye-tracking reading and the importance of developing a reproducible workflow, followed by hands-on exercises in RStudio with the R programming language. The main skills developed include data wrangling (with the tidyverse package), data visualisation (with the ggplot2 package), and running and communicating descriptive and inferential statistics. By the end of the course, students will be able to apply what they learned to a variety of data types in both academic and professional settings. This course is aimed at students who have some practical experience with R and RStudio, although this is not a strict requirement. Students who cannot bring their own laptop to class should contact the instructor as early as possible, so an alternative laptop can be organised. The language of instruction is English.
