  {"id":"clifton_eye_2007","abstract":"The two most robust findings in studies of eye movements and reading are that (1) fixation time on a word is shorter if the reader has a valid preview of the word prior to fixating it, and (2) fixation time is shorter when the word is easy to identify and understand. Word recognition processes seem to be reflected quite straightforwardly in the eye movement record. In contrast, eye movements seem to reflect sentence comprehension processes in a more varied fashion. This chapter reviews the major word identification factors that affect eye movements and describe the role these eye movement phenomena have played in developing theories of eye movements in reading. The chapter tabulates and summarizes 100 reports of how syntactic, semantic, pragmatic, and world-knowledge factors affect eye movements during reading in an initial attempt to identify order in how different types of challenges to comprehension are reflected in eye movements. The chapter reviews findings that have demonstrated effects due to (1) word frequency, (2) word familiarity, (3) age-of-acquisition, (4) number of meanings, (5) morphology, (6) contextual constraint, and (7) plausibility. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.","author":[{"family":"Clifton","given":"Charles"},{"family":"Staub","given":"Adrian"},{"family":"Rayner","given":"Keith"}],"citation-key":"clifton_eye_2007","container-title":"Eye Movements","DOI":"10.1016/B978-008044980-7/50017-3","ISSN":"9780080449807","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007]]},"page":"341-371","title":"Eye movements in reading words and sentences","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"kathawalla_easing_2021","abstract":"This article provides a roadmap to assist graduate students and their advisors to engage in open science practices. We suggest eight open science practices that novice graduate students could begin adopting today. The topics we cover include journal clubs, project workflow, preprints, reproducible code, data sharing, transparent writing, preregistration, and registered reports. To address concerns about not knowing how to engage in open science practices, we provide a difficulty rating of each behavior (easy, medium, difficult), present them in order of suggested adoption, and follow the format of what, why, how, and worries. We give graduate students ideas on how to approach conversations with their advisors/collaborators, ideas on how to integrate open science practices within the graduate school framework, and specific resources on how to engage with each behavior. We emphasize that engaging in open science behaviors need not be an all or nothing approach, but rather graduate students can engage with any number of the behaviors outlined.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Kathawalla","given":"Ummul-Kiram"},{"family":"Silverstein","given":"Priya"},{"family":"Syed","given":"Moin"}],"citation-key":"kathawalla_easing_2021","container-title":"Collabra: Psychology","DOI":"10.1525/collabra.18684","ISSN":"2474-7394","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,26]]},"language":"en","page":"18684","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Easing Into Open Science: A Guide for Graduate Students and Their Advisors","title-short":"Easing Into Open Science","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://online.ucpress.edu/collabra/article/doi/10.1525/collabra.18684/115927/Easing-Into-Open-Science-A-Guide-for-Graduate","volume":"7"},
  {"id":"vasishth_what_2013","abstract":"Eye movement data have proven to be very useful for investigating human sentence processing. Eyetracking research has addressed a wide range of questions, such as recovery mechanisms following garden-pathing, the timing of processes driving comprehension, the role of anticipation and expectation in parsing, the role of semantic, pragmatic, and prosodic information, and so on. However, there are some limitations regarding the inferences that can be made on the basis of eye movements. One relates to the nontrivial interaction between parsing and the eye movement control system which complicates the interpretation of eye movement data. Detailed computational models that integrate parsing with eye movement control theories have the potential to unpack the complexity of eye movement data and can therefore aid in the interpretation of eye movements. Another limitation is the difficulty of capturing spatiotemporal patterns in eye movements using the traditional word-based eyetracking measures. Recent research has demonstrated the relevance of these patterns and has shown how they can be analyzed. In this review, we focus on reading, and present examples demonstrating how eye movement data reveal what events unfold when the parser runs into difficulty, and how the parsing system interacts with eye movement control.

This text is different from other introductions by being decidedly conceptual; I will focus on why you want to use mixed models and how you should use them. While many introductions to this topic can be very daunting to readers who lake the appropriate statistical background, this text is going to be a softer kind of introduction… so, don't panic! The tutorial requires R – so if you haven't installed it yet, go and get it! I also recommend reading tutorial 1 in this series before you go further.
