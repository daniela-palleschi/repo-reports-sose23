# Course description

This course will provide students with the skills and know-how needed to create reproducible reports and presentations of eye-tracking reading data. A brief introduction will be given into common measures in eye-tracking reading and the importance of developing a reproducible workflow, followed by hands-on exercises in RStudio with the R programming language. The main skills developed include data wrangling (with the tidyverse package), data visualisation (with the ggplot2 package), and running and communicating descriptive and inferential statistics. By the end of the course, students will be able to apply what they learned to a variety of data types in both academic and professional settings. This course is aimed at students who have some practical experience with R and RStudio, although this is not a strict requirement. Students who cannot bring their own laptop to class should contact the instructor as early as possible, so an alternative laptop can be organised. The language of instruction is English.

## Skills and know-how

At the end of the course, you will:

-   have an understanding of common eye-tracking reading measures
-   be able to visualise reading times
-   be able to run linear mixed models on reading times
-   be able to set-up and maintain a reproducible workflow in RStudio

# Course credits

- to earn credits for this course, you need to hand in:
  + 2 in-class quizzes (15 minutes each)
  + mid-course analysis report (due May 31st)
  + final analysis report (Due August 15th)

- for the first report, we will do some work in-class
  + e.g., data wrangling and tidying
  + independent work: turning it into a *reproducible report*
- for the second report, you will get new data
  + you will need to do the wrangling and analyses independently
  + and turn it into a *reproducible report*

## Important dates

- May 31st: first report due
- August 15th: second report due
